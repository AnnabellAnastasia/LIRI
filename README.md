Liri is a one-stop command line node app that takes in parameters for songs, bands, and movies and returns relevant data.

This app makes calls to the Spotify API, BandsInTown API, and OMDB API for serach results.

When running this app in your commend line, you might use the following to find your desire data:
'spotify-this-song', 'concert-this', 'movie-this' and 'do-what-it-says'.

Here is a link to a video tutorial explaining the Liri App:
